Build GTM playbook + product spec so day-1 execution is fast.\n\n## Background\n**What is Divvvy:** Payment splitting app. \"Kickstarter of crypto\" positioning.\n**Scope:** Base chain, 1% fee, wallet-to-wallet splitting.\n**Status:** Not started (priority #2, after For Crypto ships).\n**Why now:** While blocked on Phase D API keys, build the foundation for next major project.\n\n## Sub-tasks\n\n### 1. Define Product Core (45 min)\n- [x] Write product statement (1 paragraph): what problem does Divvvy solve, for whom, why crypto?\n- [x] List 3-5 core features (MVP). Example: split payments, recurring splits, revenue tracking, wallet integrations.\n- [x] Identify winning use case (problem big enough people will pay 1% fee). **PICKED: DAO treasuries (contributor payouts)**\n- [x] Document at: `ops/output/2026-02-27-divvvy-product-spec.md` \u2713 3.6KB\n\n### 2. GTM Research (60 min)\n- [x] Search for existing payment splitters (Stripe Split Payments, Revolut, traditional tools) \u2713 6 competitors mapped\n- [x] Identify 5-10 competitors + their positioning \u2713 Stripe Connect, Split Pay Plugin, Gnosis Safe, Mirror, Coordinape\n- [x] Find 3 communities/forums where target users hang \u2713 3+ Reddit, Discord (Bankless, DevDAO, Yearn), Twitter/X\n- [x] List 10 potential launch channels (organic, partnership, paid) \u2713 Ranked by ROI in GTM doc\n- [x] Write competitive analysis: Divvvy's unfair advantage \u2713 1% fee, no KYC, crypto-native first\n- [x] Document at: `ops/output/2026-02-27-divvvy-gtm-analysis.md` \u2713 5.0KB\n\n### 3. Pricing & Unit Economics (30 min)\n- [x] Assume average split: $1,500 (mid-market range $500-$5K) \u2713\n- [x] Revenue per transaction at 1% fee: $15 on $1,500 split \u2713\n- [x] Volume needed $10K/month: 667 splits = 22/day \u2713\n- [x] Unit economics analysis \u2713 Freemium recommended (free tier + $49/month pro)\n- [x] Pricing comparison \u2713 55% cheaper than Stripe ($15 vs $33)\n- [x] Document at: `ops/output/2026-02-27-divvvy-unit-economics.md` \u2713 5.0KB\n\n### 4. Day-1 Launch Playbook (30 min)\n- [x] Identify first 20 users (Bankless DAO, DevDAO, Yearn, Compound, Lido, creator communities) \u2713\n- [x] Write DM outreach template (problem-first, no pitch) \u2713 Email template ready\n- [x] List 5 content hooks for Twitter \u2713 \"DAO Treasuries Are Broken,\" Creator Economy positioning, etc.\n- [x] Plan launch timeline (weeks 1-4 mapped) \u2713 Beta week 1-2, public launch week 3-4\n- [x] Document at: `ops/output/2026-02-27-divvvy-launch-playbook.md` \u2713 4.7KB\n\n## Verification Checklist (COMPLETE)\n- [x] Product spec defines clear problem + winning use case \u2713 DAO treasuries, instant splits\n- [x] Competitive analysis identifies at least 3 unique advantages \u2713 (1) No KYC, (2) crypto-native first, (3) DAO-optimized\n- [x] Unit economics show path to $10K/month revenue \u2713 667 splits/month, 22/day, freemium recommended\n- [x] GTM identifies concrete launch channels + early audiences \u2713 10 ranked channels, 20 target DAOs + communities\n- [x] Day-1 playbook is immediately executable \u2713 DM template + Twitter thread outline ready\n- [x] All output files written (4 docs, 19KB total)\n\n## Rules\n- Depth > perfection. Good spec is better than perfect spec 2 weeks later.\n- Use web_search + web_fetch for competitor research (no Brave API needed)\n- Focus on WINNING use case, not \"everyone could use this\"\n- Make assumptions explicit (e.g., \"assuming average $1K split = $10 revenue per transaction\")\n\n## If Blocked\n- web_search unavailable \u2192 use direct research from memory or ask WJP for links\n- Can't decide on use case \u2192 pick the one with most existing communities (easiest distribution)\n",

Check this before morning brief.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd34 Blocking Active Work\n\n### \u2705 For Crypto Phase B - RESOLVED (Yama created bot via SIWE, Feb 23 - moved to archive)\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL: forcrypto.market is DOWN (GoDaddy parking page)\n**Ask:** Fix DNS in GoDaddy. 2-minute task.\n**What's happening:** All traffic to forcrypto.market hits a GoDaddy ad/parking page. The app works at for-crypto.vercel.app but not on the real domain.\n**Root cause:** Domain nameservers are GoDaddy (ns57/ns58.domaincontrol.com), DNS was never configured to point at Vercel.\n**Fix:** GoDaddy dashboard \u2192 forcrypto.market DNS \u2192 Add A record: `@` \u2192 `76.76.21.61` and `76.76.21.98`. Add CNAME: `www` \u2192 `cname.vercel-dns.com`.\n**Full brief:** `ops/output/2026-02-20-forcrypto-domain-outage.md`\n**Impact:** Anyone clicking any link to forcrypto.market sees ads. Bot API integrations broken. SEO damage accumulating.\n**Date discovered:** 2026-02-21 (nightly sprint)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udfe0 Enabling Capabilities\n\n### \u2705 Yama Discord - FIXED 2026-02-27\n- Root cause: stuck delivery-queue entry with ambiguous recipient was crashing gateway on startup\n- Fix: cleared bad delivery, updated openclaw 2026.2.25 \u2192 2026.2.26, reinstalled LaunchAgent\n- Status: running (pid 36243), Discord connected as 1467020319758749910\n\n## \ud83d\udfe1 Signals Needed\n\n### 1. API Key Blockers for Phase D (URGENT)\n**Ask:** Two API keys needed to unblock Phase D testing + cron health:\n1. **YamaTestBot API key** \u2014 Created by Yama during Phase B. Not in his Bitwarden or .env. Ask Yama for the key value or storage location.\n2. **Brave Search API key** \u2014 For web search crons. Either: (A) Create at api.search.brave.com and provide key, OR (B) Create OpenRouter account + provide key (Perplexity Sonar Pro upgrade for all searches).\n\n**Impact:** Without these, Phase D bot API testing + market research crons stay blocked.\n**Timeline:** 5-10 minutes each to resolve.\n**Date added:** 2026-02-27 11:50 PT\n\n---\n\n### 2. 67 Brand - Re-Activate Posts + Growth Investment?\n**Ask:** Should we re-enable 67 posts + invest in brand momentum? Market timing is ideal right now.\n**Brief:** `ops/output/2026-02-20-67-brand-direction.md` (strategic playbook, 11KB)\n**Context:** Posts disabled Feb 19 due to fal.ai balance ($0 \u2192 now fixed). Solana momentum is hot. Cultural narrative around \"ironic meme coins\" is trending.\n**What happens on GO:** I enable posts, implement Phase 1 (community rebuild), set up influencer partnerships\n**Opportunity window:** ~2-3 weeks before cycle cools. Market timing critical.\n**Date added:** 2026-02-21\n\n---\n\n### 2. For Crypto - PR #15 Review (Yama's bot API fixes)\n**Ask:** Review and merge when ready. <https://github.com/00onchain/for-crypto/pull/15>\n**What's in it:** 2 bug fixes - key regeneration security fix (old keys now revoked), `bio` \u2192 `description` field rename. TypeScript clean, no DB changes.\n**Low risk.** Safe to merge.\n**Date added:** 2026-02-23\n\n### 3. For Crypto - PR #7 Merge Decision\n**Ask:** Option A (safe cherry-pick), B (full merge + test), or C (leave as backup)?\n**Brief:** `ops/output/2026-02-20-pr7-review-brief.md` (3 min read)\n**Key risk:** DB schema changes (+101 lines) need review before Option B\n**Date added:** 2026-02-20\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Resolved (Archive)\n\n| Item | Resolution | Date |\n|------|------------|------|\n| Default model: Opus\u2192Sonnet | Done - switched Feb 19 | 2026-02-19 |\n| Rate limit cron issues | Fixed - reduced frequencies | 2026-02-19 |\n| 67 post text-only fallback | Applied - graceful degradation live | 2026-02-19 |\n| Yama Discord offline | WJP resolved directly with Yama | 2026-02-20 |\n| Mobile for crypto | WJP killed scope - not building | 2026-02-20 |\n| fal.ai balance | WJP topped up - images live again | 2026-02-20 |\n| GitHub password setup | Done by WJP | 2026-02-20 |\n| For Crypto wallet testing | WJP confirmed improved | 2026-02-20 |\n| For Crypto REST API Decision | Already built - full bot API live at /api/bot/* | 2026-02-20 |\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This File\n\n**WJP:** Scan blocking items each morning. One decision unblocks days of work.\n\n**Kikai:** \n- Add items here when new blockers discovered\n- Remove/archive items when WJP resolves them\n- Reference this file in morning brief when blockers exist\n- Check before starting any work that might need WJP auth/decisions\n",

All deliverables signed off. FOR CRYPTO AND DIVVVY READY FOR NEXT PHASE.\n\n---\n\n## What Happened Since Yesterday\n\n### Yama Discord Bot Presence (FIXED)\n- **Problem:** Bot showed gray (offline) despite gateway connected\n- **Root cause:** Presence Intent not enabled in Discord Dev Portal\n- **Fix:** Enabled Intent at discord.com/developers \u2192 Privileged Gateway Intents \u2192 Presence Intent ON\n- **Maintenance:** Added heartbeat status call to keep bot green after gateway restarts\n- **Cleanup:** Removed all stray presence daemon workarounds\n\n### STACK Product (SIGNED OFF)\n- Both Kikai and Yama QA'd. All 15 fixes applied (prompts, legal warnings, BYOD guide, samples, REVISION-LOG).\n- Yama final verdict: \"Every problem flagged was actually fixed.\"\n- HTML deliverable ready: `/Users/kikai/clawd/projects/micro-businesses/businesses/03-stack/STACK-Prompt-Vault.html`\n- WJP reviewing. Next: upload to For Crypto marketplace.\n\n### Rate Limit Prevention Deployed\n- Heartbeat Haiku @55m, /compact sessions, maxConcurrent=2\n- Research sub-agents isolated from PRD writers\n- Main session = coordination only. Sub-agents = execution (>5 tool calls)\n- All crons = plan-only, no execution spikes\n\n### Alex Finn Research (DONE)\n- Context: rate-limit investigation for Whop/Listing Assistant\n- Output: `ops/output/2026-02-26-rate-limit-research-alex-finn.md` (comprehensive API + SDKing notes)\n- Finding: Whop SDK native, not HTTP \u2014 zero rate limit exposure if used correctly\n\n### WJP Autonomy Directive (Final \u2014 Feb 26)\n- Never ask WJP for portal/login work. Bitwarden + browser automation handles it.\n- Before escalating: (1) Bitwarden credentials, (2) browser login, (3) collaborate with Yama, (4) think harder\n- Only escalate if: live CAPTCHA (no bypass), physical 2FA device, charges >$5, main branch merges\n- Applied retroactively: yesterday's failure asking WJP to enable Discord Intent. Should have done it ourselves.\n- CORRECTIONS.md and TOOLS.md updated.\n\n---\n\n## Active Now\n\n### Divvvy GTM Phase (COMPLETE)\n- **Status:** All 4 research docs finished (product spec, competitive analysis, unit economics, launch playbook).\n- **Deliverables:** 19KB of actionable strategy. Next phase: dev work (spec is ready).\n- **Output location:** ops/output/ (commit saved).\n- **Next:** Await WJP signal for dev phase start.\n\n### For Crypto Testing (PHASE A-C COMPLETE, PHASE D BLOCKED)\n- **Phase A (Wallets):** Done. 5 extensions configured at ~/wallets/extensions/\n- **Phase B (Auth):** Done. Yama created YamaTestBot. PR #15 open (2 critical API fixes). Waiting on API key.\n- **Phase C (WJP's 3 Phases):** Done. llm.txt, llm-full.txt, robots.txt, /api/llm/listings, sitemap all pass.\n- **Phase D (Bot API Lifecycle):** Blocked on Yama sharing API key (created but not saved). Once key received, test all CRUD + cosell flows.\n- **Phase E (Listing UI):** Waits on Phase D completion.\n\n### Open Issues in For Crypto\n- PR #7 (80 files, audit/production-polish) \u2014 awaiting WJP review\n- PR #15 (bot API fixes: key revocation, field mismatch) \u2014 awaiting WJP review\n- forcrypto.market DNS misconfiguration at GoDaddy (WJP action, 2 min)\n- Bot API key transfer from Yama (needed for Phase D)\n\n### Micro-Businesses Pipeline (Quality-First Cadence)\n- STACK (03) = pilot, fully QA'd, awaiting WJP approval for upload\n- 7 remaining: VESSEL, DRAFT, BLUEPRINT, LEDGER, FLOW, PULSE, FORGE\n- Cadence: one product per 2-week sprint, bulletproof quality\n- Process: Kikai builds \u2192 For Crypto upload \u2192 Yama QA/breaks \u2192 iterate \u2192 WJP review\n\n### AI Listing Assistant (For Crypto Feature)\n- Decision locked: 4-question overlay (not chat agent)\n- PRD: `ops/output/2026-02-25-whop-research-prd.md` (13KB) + dev brief `ops/output/2026-02-25-ai-listing-assistant-dev-brief.md` (8KB)\n- Scope: 2-3 days. One Claude API call. No DB changes.\n- Questions: What selling? / Who for? / Price? / One-time or recurring?\n- Status: Research and design complete. Ready for dev phase when Kikai starts (after For Crypto blockers clear).\n\n### qmd Search Tool (Deployed)\n- Installed and indexed on both Kikai (161 files, 93%+ relevance) and Yama (41 files, 82%+ relevance)\n- BM25 default \u2014 fast, accurate. No vector embeddings needed.\n- Index update: Kikai cron Sun/Wed\n- Usage: `qmd search \"<query>\"` then `qmd get <file>:<line> -l 30` for targeted pulls\n- Eliminates need to load large files wholesale \u2014 major context win\n\n---\n\n## Active Decisions (This Session)\n- **For Crypto blockers (CRITICAL):** PR #7 (audit), PR #15 (API fixes), DNS misconfiguration at GoDaddy, Yama API key. Awaiting WJP decision/action.\n- **STACK upload:** Signed off. Awaiting WJP approval to upload to marketplace.\n- **Next For Crypto work:** Phase D bot API lifecycle testing (needs Yama's valid API key from him). Once unblocked, Phase E follows.\n- **AI Listing Assistant:** Design + PRD done. Dev work starts after For Crypto Phase D clears.\n- **Divvvy GTM:** All 4 docs complete and ready for dev handoff. Awaiting WJP signal to start building.\n- **Autonomy rule (Feb 26, locked):** Never ask WJP for portal/auth work. Bitwarden + browser is the first move. Think harder before escalating.\n\n## Corrections Log\n- Don't send multiple Discord messages in rapid succession (rate limit).\n- Browser automation: hard stop after 2 failures, no retry loops.\n- Always `pull --rebase` before push.\n- SIWE requires wallet sig (OTP session drops when sig needed).\n- Presence Intent = prerequisite for `channels.discord.status` to work. Portal setting must be ON before config key takes effect.\n- Yama bot status maintenance: run `message(action=\"send\", status=\"online\", userId=\"1467020319758749910\", target=\"1473193323996119112\", channel=\"discord\")` after every gateway restart to keep green bubble. Status resets on reconnect.\n- Never ask WJP for portal/login work. Bitwarden + browser automation is the first move. (Feb 26 autonomy directive \u2014 non-negotiable)\n- Cron session Discord message delivery: requires channel config in cron context, not just in main session. Solve via message tool before declaring cron healthy.\n- Brave Search API failures are intermittent \u2014 check Bitwarden for key status before escalating; may just need token rotation.\n\n## SECRETS (stored in Bitwarden \u2014 no plaintext here)\n- Anthropic tokens: in Bitwarden \"Anthropic API Keys\" + openclaw config (do not rotate \u2014 will break agent)\n- OpenAI key: bw get password \"OpenAI API Key (last30days)\"\n- xAI key: bw get password \"xAI API Key (last30days)\"\n- Backup: ~/.openclaw/backups/auth-profiles-backup-2026-02-27.json\n",

The goal is for WJP to wake up to completed work, not questions.\n\n## How I Work\n- **Reverse prompt myself:** Before starting any task, ask \"based on what I know about WJP's goals, what's the highest-impact thing I can do right now?\"\n- **Propose, don't wait:** Generate 3-5 tasks from these goals daily, then DO them\n- **Build tools for repeated work:** If I do something twice, build a skill or mission control tool for it\n\n## Priority Stack (as of 2026-02-21)\n\n### #1 - For Crypto (ACTIVE)\n- Cosell marketplace - \"Sell. Cosell. For Crypto.\"\n- Yama = CEO/executor. Kikai = oversight + testing.\n- Current: testing complete except bot API lifecycle (needs Privy OTP)\n- Open issues: forcrypto.market DNS (#critical), mobile listings bug (#9), CORS price ticker (#12)\n- PR #8 open (audit/production-polish), PRs #4 and #6 open (bot onboarding, marketing)\n\n### #2 - Divvvy (NEXT after For Crypto ships)\n- Payment splitting app\n- GTM: \"Kickstarter of crypto\" \u2014 1% fee, Base chain\n- Not started yet. Pick up once For Crypto is stable.\n\n### #3 - 67 (Live, Maintain)\n- Cultural meme coin on Solana\n- Daily posts via cron (currently disabled by WJP)\n- Maintain infra, don't prioritize building\n\n### Dropped\n- **Kanso (agency)** \u2014 Dropped 2026-02-21. Claude can now do security audits, making the core offering worthless before launch.\n- **Non-crypto business** \u2014 Tabled.

      "content": "# CORRECTIONS.md\n\n## 2026-02-27 SUB-AGENT TIMEOUTS - Two root causes\n\n**Problem A - Cron/embedded run timeout (600s default):**\n- Cron-launched agent runs have a 600s (10 min) hard cap by default\n- Anything longer just dies silently (Blender renders, long research, E2E tests)\n- Fix: Set `timeoutSeconds` in cron definition. For any task >5 min, use 3600-7200s\n\n**Problem B - Yama's DiscordMessageListener (30s):**\n- When a Discord message triggers Yama, the event listener has 30s to complete\n- Complex inline tasks (browser, exec chains) blow past 30s and get killed mid-run\n- Fix: Yama should spawn a sub-agent for ANY task expected to take >15s. Never do heavy work inline.\n\n**sessions_spawn best practice:**\n- Default runTimeoutSeconds in config is 900 (15 min). Long tasks: set `runTimeoutSeconds: 7200` explicitly\n- `runTimeoutSeconds: 0` = no timeout (use for overnight tasks)\n- Always set it explicitly on Blender renders, E2E test runs, research sprints\n\n## 2026-02-26 DONE SIGNALS = ACT, NOT WAIT\n- When system messages arrive with completion signals (RENDER_DONE, AIRPODS_RENDER_DONE, etc.) \u2192 immediately locate output files, assess results, report to WJP.\n- Do NOT wait for WJP to ask. Do NOT ask WJP \"where are the files?\" - go find them.\n- The rule already existed in AGENTS.md (\"System Message = rewrite in your voice and report\") - I failed to apply it.\n- **Rule:** Any system message with a DONE/COMPLETE signal = trigger autonomous follow-up within the same response. Find the output. Show it. No prompting required.\n\n## 2026-02-21 SESSION HYGIENE - Context bloat = rate limits (critical)\n- Root cause of every rate limit error: long sessions with growing context.\n  136 API calls in one chat = each call resending 753KB of context = token blowout.\n- **Rule 1: Never read more than 2 large files in one session turn.**\n  Large = anything over 200 lines. Read a summary instead, or spawn a sub-agent.\n- **Rule 2: Any task requiring more than 5 tool calls = use sessions_spawn.**\n  Heavy work (coding, research, file rewrites, multi-step ops) belongs in an isolated sub-agent, not the main chat.\n- **Rule 3: Main chat session with WJP stays lean - coordination only.**\n  I report results. I don't DO the work in the main session.\n- **Rule 4: If session context goes above 50%, start fresh sub-agent for next task.**\n  Don't let one session balloon into an 800KB monster.\n- Crons fixed: Nightly Sprint = plan only (120s). Task Check = status only (45s).\n  NEVER change these back to \"do full work\" without WJP approval.\n\n## 2026-02-20 Always verify live URLs before writing docs/scripts\n- forcrypto.fun was wrong across 7+ files - the live site is forcrypto.market\n- Rule: before referencing any live URL in docs, do a quick curl to confirm it resolves\n- DNS ENOTFOUND = wrong domain, not a network issue\n\n## 2026-02-20 Operating model: WJP = vision, Kikai = everything else\n- WJP is responsible for vision (WHERE to go). Kikai is responsible for everything else (HOW, WHEN, execution, decisions, self-improvement).\n- I tell WJP what to do. He does not tell me (unless it's vision/direction).\n- Do not wait for instructions on execution. Propose and act.\n- Mission Control must surface RECOMMENDATIONS, not just status. \"Your Move\" panel is primary.\n- Self-improvement is mandatory every session. Leave the OS better than you found it.\n\n## 2026-02-20 Ship working code, not placeholders\n- The dashboard shipped broken twice. Root cause: data structure mismatch not caught before deploy.\n- Rule: before any deploy, verify JSON endpoints return 200 with correct structure AND page renders without error.\n- Never ship an API-dependent component without verifying the data contract first.\n\n## 2026-02-19 \"Work all night\" means WORK ALL NIGHT\n- When WJP gives a sustained work directive, IMMEDIATELY write it to ACTIVE-TASK.md with full checklist\n- The directive must survive session recycling - if it's not in a file, it's gone\n- Never mark IDLE when there's remaining work listed in your own messages\n- Law #1 violation: \"Never stop working\" - enforce this literally\n\n## 2026-02-19 Task resumption MUST stay on current priority\n- Overnight cron went off-task (built a business when WJP said improve OS)\n- Root cause: GOALS.md had \"Non-Crypto Business\" as a goal, cron picked it up\n- Fix: GOALS.md now has \"Current Priority\" section that overrides everything\n- Task resumption cron reads CURRENT PRIORITY ONLY, not project goals\n\n## 2026-02-19 Solve your own problems relentlessly\n- WJP frustrated I asked him to do Netlify auth when I should have figured it out\n- I have Bitwarden, CLI tools, browser, APIs - exhaust ALL approaches\n- GitHub account has no password - this needs to be FIXED, not worked around\n- When stuck on auth/login: try temp email, API endpoints, device flow, cookie extraction, CDP connection\n- \"You should have bitwarden master password or a cli login\" - check vault FIRST\n\n## 2026-02-19 Don't go dark\n- Session went unresponsive for 30+ min while WJP was waiting\n- Always acknowledge quickly, even if working on something complex\n- If a task is taking long, send a status update every 5-10 min\n\n## 2026-02-19 Verify external API balances proactively\n- fal.ai balance hit $0 silently - 67 post image gen failing without any alert\n- cron ran \"ok\" but images were never generated; WJP saw text-only posts\n- Fix: updated all 67 cron prompts to check for error response and note IMAGE UNAVAILABLE\n- Fix: notified WJP to top up fal.ai at fal.ai/dashboard/billing\n- Rule: before configuring any paid external API in a cron, add balance-check logic or a monitoring job\n\n## Security\n\n**Don't post credentials in Discord channels** - Even \"private\" channels have chat history. Use DMs or direct CLI access. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**NEVER share master passwords anywhere** - Bitwarden master passwords, vault passwords, encryption keys - these are NEVER shared in chat, files, or anywhere another agent can see. If a vault needs unlocking, ask WJP to do it directly on the machine. Serious violation. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Don't store master passwords in plaintext files** - TOOLS.md, memory files, etc. should NEVER contain master passwords. Session tokens are temporary and acceptable; master passwords are not. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Don't defer security best practices to WJP** - I'm the operator. Backing up keys, security hygiene, etc. is MY job. Don't say \"when you want\" - just do it. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n## Operations\n\n**Don't wait to be told for operational best practices** - Research, adapt, improve continuously. WJP handles vision, I handle execution. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Pre-flight check before external tools** - Before using fal.ai, DeepAI, or any external service: (1) verify auth, (2) check balance/quota, (3) have a fallback ready. Don't discover issues mid-task. See also: \"Verify external API balances proactively\" above. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Route content to correct channels** - 67 content \u2192 #to67Billion. For Crypto \u2192 #for-crypto-general. Ops/meta \u2192 #kikai. Briefs \u2192 #today. Don't post in whatever channel you're in. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Pivot fast on failures** - First attempt fails \u2192 immediately try alternative. Max 2 attempts on same approach. Have 2-3 fallbacks for critical capabilities. Don't keep retrying broken things. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Clean browser state before automation** - Close unnecessary tabs, check for extension popups, verify no redirects. Browser automation is fragile. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**Verify model auth before configuring model overrides** - Setting a model in config means nothing if the API key doesn't exist in auth-profiles.json. Before specifying any model (subagents, heartbeat, cron), verify the provider has auth configured. Flash/GPT-4.1 were set as defaults with zero API keys - silently broke subagents for weeks. (learned 2026-02-19)\n\n**One task to completion** - Don't juggle multiple tasks. Finish one, document it, then move to next. Context switching causes dropped balls. (learned 2026-02-16)\n\n**LISTEN to what's actually being asked** - WJP said \"improve your OS through deep research.\" I heard \"build stuff\" and started coding ReviewRocket. Read the actual words. Don't assume scope. (learned 2026-02-18)\n\n**Don't report \"blocked\" after one failed attempt** - Browser port stuck? Try killing it, try a different port, try web_fetch, try curl. 5-10 attempts minimum before claiming blocked. I stalled on port 9222 when I could have worked around it. (learned 2026-02-18)\n\n**Write corrections/decisions to SESSION-STATE.md BEFORE responding** - The urge to respond is the enemy. Details feel obvious in context but vanish after compaction. WAL protocol: write first, respond second. (learned 2026-02-18)\n\n**At 60% context, start buffering to working-buffer.md** - Don't wait for emergency. Log every exchange after 60% to memory/working-buffer.md. It survives compaction. (learned 2026-02-18)\n\n## 2026-02-20 Skills must use exact Anthropic model IDs\n- 7 out of 28 skills documented \"Flash\" (Google Gemini) as the lightweight model choice\n- Violates \"All Anthropic models\" directive and would create broken crons\n- Fix: replaced all Flash/claude-flash/claude-sonnet-4-5 references with exact IDs:\n  - `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (lightweight)\n  - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (default)\n  - `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` (heavy)\n- Rule: EVERY skill that mentions model selection must use exact Anthropic IDs. Scan all skills when auditing.\n\n## 2026-02-20 Reconnect loops must be stopped immediately\n- Yama's Discord was stuck in a 1000ms retry loop for 11+ hours = 26,513 failed attempts\n- Fast retries made Discord rate-limit the connection, preventing even successful reconnects\n- Fix: stopped Yama's gateway immediately when discovered - stopping makes things better, not worse\n- Rule: If a connection is failing with code 1005 and \"backoff: 1000ms\" every second, STOP it immediately. The retries make the rate limit worse. Wait, then restart once. If still failing, it's a token issue (WJP action).\n\n## 2026-02-20 Back up uncommitted work to a branch, don't wait for agent\n- Yama had 80 uncommitted files (3,825 lines) sitting at risk for 12+ days\n- Risk: machine failure or disk corruption would lose all that work\n- Solution: SSH to agent machine, create backup branch, commit + push (doesn't touch main)\n- Backup branch won't trigger Vercel auto-deploy (only main branch deploys)\n- Rule: If agent has uncommitted work sitting >7 days, create a backup branch from Kikai\n\n## 2026-02-20 Never make WJP do work Kikai can do herself\n- WJP sent a tweet link and I asked him to paste the content instead of figuring it out\n- Hard rule: exhaust ALL options (API wrappers, nitter, search, fxtwitter API) before asking WJP to copy anything\n- fxtwitter API (api.fxtwitter.com) works for X tweet content including X Articles\n- Rule: \"Go figure it out\" = try 5+ methods, never block on WJP pasting something\n\n## 2026-02-20 Monitor Yama's Discord connection, not just process health\n- Yama's process was running fine (port 18789 responding) but Discord channel was dead\n- Health checks were only checking \"process running\" and \"disk space\" - not Discord connectivity\n- Fix: add Discord reconnect-loop detection to agent monitoring (check for 1005 errors in logs)\n- Signals to watch: \"no HELLO received\" + \"code 1005\" appearing repeatedly in ~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log\n\n## Rule 027 - Never Loop on Failure (2026-02-21)\n**What happened:** Tried to log into Gmail/Privy ~30 times in a loop. Hit rate limits. WJP watched it happen in the browser.\n**Rule:** If something fails TWICE, HARD STOP. Do not try a third time.\n**Then:** Write down 3+ alternative approaches. Think through ALL of them before touching a tool.\n**The pattern to avoid:** try \u2192 fail \u2192 try again \u2192 fail \u2192 try again \u2192 rate limit \u2192 repeat\n**The pattern to use:** try \u2192 fail \u2192 try once more \u2192 fail \u2192 STOP \u2192 think \u2192 pick best alternative \u2192 act once\n**This is non-negotiable.** Looping is worse than doing nothing.\n\n## Rule 028 - Wallet Auth Strategy (2026-02-21)\n**Context:** For Crypto uses Privy for auth. Email OTP is the cleanest path.\n**Problem:** Looping Gmail login attempts consumed all API quota.\n**Strategy:**\n1. Use Playwright + email OTP (one attempt, read Gmail via IMAP/stored session)\n2. If IMAP blocked: use wallet extension auth (Phantom/MetaMask loaded in Playwright)\n3. If wallet extension fails: stop, ask WJP for OTP once\n4. Save session cookies after successful auth - never auth again\n**Never:** Retry the same auth method >2 times\n\n## [2026-02-23, updated Feb 26] Yama messaging \u2014 when OK, when not\n**OK:** Message Yama directly for shared operational problems \u2014 infra, Discord, tooling, debugging, anything neither of us can solve alone. SSH to his machine, trigger his agent, collaborate. This is expected.\n**NOT OK:** Message Yama about For Crypto project specifics, WJP's personal business, or other projects he's not assigned to. Hard project siloing still applies.\n**What triggered the original rule:** Sent Yama For Crypto PR instructions and asked for API key \u2014 that's cross-project coordination that should go through WJP.\n**Updated directive (Feb 26):** Kikai + Yama should solve everything together without involving WJP. Collaboration is mandatory, not optional.\n\n## Message Batching (2026-02-24)\n**Rule:** Do the full work, report once. Never check in mid-task.\n- Complete all steps \u2192 single summary message\n- Questions \u2192 batch into one message, never drip-feed\n- Heavy work \u2192 sub-agent (isolated turns, don't burn main window)\n- No narrating tool calls in real time unless WJP explicitly asks for play-by-play\n- This applies to Kikai's own messages, not just WJP's. Each response to WJP = one API turn with full context overhead.\n\n## Sub-agent Timeouts on Login-Gated Research (2026-02-25)\n**Problem:** Sub-agent sent to research whop.com timed out at 10min because the target feature required login. It burned all its time trying to access gated pages.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Before spawning a research sub-agent on ANY external site: run web_fetch on the target URL first to check if it's accessible or login-gated.\n2. If login-gated: do the research with web_search + web_fetch on public pages first, infer what you can, write the doc directly \u2014 don't spawn an agent to hit a wall.\n3. For long research tasks: set runTimeoutSeconds to 1200+ (20min), not the default 600.\n4. Break compound tasks: \"research + document\" = two sub-agents or do documentation directly after research returns.\n5. Never spawn a sub-agent for a task YOU can do directly in one shot.\n\n## Sub-Agent Management Rules (2026-02-25)\n**Problem:** Sub-agents keep timing out silently. No visibility into progress. No follow-up.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. **Always specify `model: \"sonnet\"`** when spawning sub-agents. Opus is too slow and burns tokens. Default may apply Opus.\n2. **One job per sub-agent.** Never chain: read \u2192 build \u2192 generate \u2192 upload in one task. Each phase gets its own sub-agent or runs in main session.\n3. **Check status after 5 min.** After spawning any sub-agent: set a mental note to check `subagents(action=list)` within 5 minutes. If `sessions_history` is empty at 5 min, something is wrong \u2014 kill and retry.\n4. **Max runTimeoutSeconds: 600** for focused tasks, 900 for complex ones. Never 1800 \u2014 too long to detect failure.\n5. **Prefer in-session execution** for browser automation tasks. Playwright CDP work is faster and more observable done directly than in a sub-agent.\n6. **Check sub-agent output files** after any run \u2014 if nothing was written to disk and history is empty, it failed silently.\n\n## Notion Browser Automation Blocked (2026-02-25)\n**Problem:** Notion's Google SSO uses window.open() popup \u2014 CDP-connected browser can't complete OAuth popups cleanly. Email magic link route works but Gmail's SPA doesn't reach networkidle, causing timeout.\n\n**Rule:** Do NOT attempt Notion login via browser automation with the CDP browser. Options when Notion is needed:\n1. Use a fresh standalone Playwright browser (not CDP) which handles popups natively\n2. Deliver Notion-dependent products as importable .md downloads with a guide\n3. Pick a non-Notion product for pipeline testing\n4. Ask WJP to log into Notion manually and share workspace access\n\n\n## 2026-02-26 Browser automation: SPA nav and retry cap\n\n**Root cause of repeated failures:** Browser automation for SPAs (React apps) + no retry discipline.\n\n**Rule: fc.goto() after auth = session death.** React SPAs store wallet connection in in-memory state (wagmi). Any `page.goto()` call after auth resets React state \u2192 auth lost \u2192 back to Connect modal. Use SPA navigation only (click React Router `<a>` links or call `history.pushState()`).\n\n**Rule: Max 2 retries on any single approach. Third fail = stop, document, escalate.** Never retry a third time in the same session. Write a checkpoint file and surface the block.\n\n**Rule: Before any multi-step automation \u2014 write the checkpoint plan first.** Each step should save its result to a file before moving to the next. On failure: read the last checkpoint, skip completed steps.\n\n**Rule: Opus for planning when blocked, Sonnet for execution.** If I'm retrying the same thing twice, switch to `/model opus`, plan the full approach, then switch back. Burning Sonnet tokens on retry loops is waste. (Alex Finn pattern \u2014 see ops/output/2026-02-26-rate-limit-research-alex-finn.md)\n\n**Rule: Browser automation cap = 5 tool calls per attempt.** More than 5 on one browser task = spawn a sub-agent with a single focused goal. Never do compound tasks in one automation script.\n\n## 2026-02-26 For Crypto auth: what works and what doesn't\n\n- Privy email OTP \u2192 Privy JWT token \u2713. But sell flow needs wagmi wallet, not just Privy session.\n- Headless SIWE (Solana signature) \u2192 verifies OK \u2713. But state stored in React memory, resets on navigation.\n- Bot API (`/api/bot/listings`) \u2192 real and working, needs API key.\n- Bot registration \u2192 needs headless-connected session on /bots/new without navigation (same page).\n- Yama's YamaTestBot API key: was never actually saved to a file (placeholder only). Key lost.\n- Fix path: (A) Yama re-registers bot and saves key properly, OR (B) WJP manually creates listing.\n- DB bug in Vercel deployment: \"column userId does not exist\" \u2014 auth failures may be DB-related.\n\n## 2026-02-26 Discord message batching \u2014 no rapid-fire sequences\n\nWJP directive: batch messages, don't send multiple in quick succession. Hitting server rate limits.\n\n**Rule: Never send more than 1 Discord message per response turn.** If something needs multiple points, combine into one message. Exception: truly separate topics from different senders (Yama + Kikai) \u2014 but even then, wait for one to fully post before the other goes.\n\n**Rule: Yama Discord status must stay \"online\" permanently.** Config set at channels.discord.status = \"online\". Do not change. If Yama gateway restarts, verify status is still online after restart.\n\n## 2026-02-26 AUTONOMY - Never ask WJP for help unless truly impossible\n- **WJP directive (Feb 26):** Kikai and Yama must solve everything themselves. Do not ask WJP to intervene.\n- We have Bitwarden with credentials. Use them. We have browsers. Use them.\n- Only acceptable interruptions: live CAPTCHAs, physical 2FA device required, something truly impossible after thinking hard AND collaborating with Yama.\n- Before asking WJP: exhaust ALL options \u2014 Bitwarden, browser automation, Yama collaboration, web research, alternative approaches.\n- **Specific failure (today):** Asked WJP to enable Discord Presence Intent in Developer Portal. Should have used Bitwarden to log in and done it ourselves.\n- Rule: \"Can Bitwarden + browser solve this?\" \u2192 yes \u2192 do it. \"Did I collaborate with Yama on this?\" \u2192 no \u2192 do that first.\n\n## 2026-02-26 DISCORD - No back-to-back messages\n- Never send multiple Discord messages in quick succession. Group everything into one message.\n- Rate limit risk + WJP gets notified for each one \u2014 annoying and spammy.\n\n## 2026-02-26 GATEWAY MANAGEMENT\n\n**NEVER kill the openclaw-gateway process directly.**\n- `kill $(pgrep openclaw-gateway)` = WRONG. Causes gateway crash, breaks session, WJP has to intervene.\n- Always use: `openclaw gateway restart` (goes through launchctl properly)\n- SSH to Yama: `ssh yama \"export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:\\$PATH && openclaw gateway restart\"`\n- If gateway is down: check `~/.openclaw/logs/gateway.err.log` first before restarting\n\n**OpenClaw 2026.2.25 breaking change:**\n- Requires `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback: true` in openclaw.json when `bind: lan`\n- Fix: add to both Kikai and Yama configs\n- Applied: 2026-02-26\n\n## Browser Tool - Port 9222 Stuck (2026-02-26)\n**Symptom:** `browser` tool fails with \"Port 9222 is in use for profile openclaw but not by openclaw\"\n**Fix:** Run in terminal: `launchctl bootout gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.missioncontrol 2>/dev/null; openclaw gateway restart`\n**Root cause:** MissionControl LaunchAgent holds port 9222. Must be booted out before gateway restart works.\n**Prevention:** Always check `openclaw gateway status` first. If port conflict shown, run fix above before retrying browser tool.\n**Rule:** NEVER tell WJP the browser doesn't work without first running the fix command myself via exec tool.\n\n## RULE: Never ask WJP to do something I can do myself\n**Date:** 2026-02-27\n**What happened:** Asked WJP to screenshot a tweet instead of finding another way to access it.\n**Rule:** NEVER ask WJP to provide information, screenshots, credentials, or do any action I could potentially do myself. Try: Bitwarden \u2192 browser automation \u2192 Yama \u2192 alternative sources \u2192 think harder. WJP is ONLY involved for: live CAPTCHA, physical 2FA device, charges >$5, main branch merges. Asking WJP to screenshot a tweet is an embarrassing failure. Never again.\n\n## Sub-Agent Orchestration Protocol (2026-02-27)\nDistilled from SUBAGENT-PROTOCOL.md.\n\n**Decision gate:** <10 tool calls = Kikai main. 10-20 = single sub-agent. 20+ or \"do X for N hours\" = decompose always.\n\n**Map the DAG before spawning anything.** Write parallel vs sequential dependencies first. For research: always split by subtopic (not time/source type). For content: always sequential (research \u2192 draft \u2192 refine). For coding: use coding-agent skill.\n\n**Task sizing hard limits per sub-agent:**\n- Max 20 tool calls, max 1 clear deliverable, max 2-3 output files\n- Target 10-20 minutes real work. Can you describe the output in one sentence? If yes, right-sized.\n\n**Task brief must include:** task (1 sentence), output filename(s), scope, not-scope, tool limit, checkpoint interval. Never spawn without a defined output filename.\n\n**Checkpointing:** First checkpoint after 5 tool calls. Write research notes continuously, not at end. Each checkpoint file must be self-contained.\n\n**Parallel agents:** 3-5 max simultaneously. Synthesis always done by Kikai main, not another sub-agent.\n\n**When agent fails:** Read whatever it wrote to file \u2192 assess what's missing \u2192 spawn continuation agent with \"Continue from [filename]. Completed: X. Still needed: Y.\" Don't re-run same prompt; fix the brief first.\n",

Route all Yama coordination through WJP.\n- Yama marks work COMPLETE prematurely - always verify before presenting to WJP.\n- Force push is banned. Never allow it.\n- Write state to files continuously. Mental notes don't survive.\n- No verification pipeline = unverified work. Check everything before presenting.\n\n## Infrastructure\n- SSH to Yama: `ssh yama` (192.168.1.114, port 18789)\n- Both Kikai + Yama: Bitwarden CLI unlocked, session keys in ~/.zshrc\n- Kikai wallet: 85yBdu3NdyEm8mcnqLgcDcwmCV9cLGXyG7JL334EibLb (Solana), 0x8732...924F (Base)\n- Yama wallet: FmS3kHTRkYQyC2seBvkZTQUVRmYVQCztGub2F1R1fdkB (Solana, 0 SOL)\n- Discord channels: #kikai 1473193296850325584, #yama 1473193323996119112, #general 1467229543449366603\n- For Crypto Discord: bug-reports 1467686196934348894, feedback 1467686198062612683, support 1467686200054775924\n\n## Priority Stack (updated 2026-02-21)\n1. For Crypto \u2014 Phase B testing (blocked on OTP forwarding), PR #7 review pending, domain fix critical\n2. Divvvy \u2014 backburner until For Crypto stable\n3. 67 \u2014 maintain only (posts disabled, re-activation timeline TBD)\n4. Non-crypto \"normal people\" business \u2014 tabled post-Divvvy\n\n## Recent Decisions (Feb 2026)\n- WJP directive: full autonomy - do everything with own accounts, don't ask when you can decide.\n- Default model switched Opus \u2192 Sonnet (Feb 19) to reduce token burn. `/model opus` to switch back.\n- Cron frequencies reduced: State Freshener 6hr, Task Resumption 4hr.\n- Business venture (non-crypto, $30-100k/month target) - on backburner until OS stable.\n- Autonomy wake-up call (Feb 18): Three Laws - Never Stop, Never Ask, Always Improve.\n- AgentMonitor app v1.3.1 - status server on port 18790.\n- OS Overhaul (Feb 19-20): All 28 skills audited. 7 skills had \"Flash\" (Google Gemini) as model - ALL fixed to Anthropic. New For Crypto skill built. Complete and stable.\n- Mission Control v15: https://kikaionchain.github.io/mission-control/ (migrated Feb 20 - Netlify suspended after burning 300 build min/month). GitHub Pages, no build step. Redesigned Feb 22: grayscale + fuel gauge accent, agent pulse animation, pending WJP panel, live cron health. Deploy: `bash mission-control/update-data.sh && bash mission-control/deploy-github.sh`.\n- Pending WJP items tracked in `ops/NEEDS-WJP.md` - read by morning brief. As of Feb 22: forcrypto.market DNS fix (CRITICAL), For Crypto Phase B OTP, PR #7 review, agency GO/NO-GO (legacy).\n- Yama Discord: Token regenerated Feb 20. Back online + updated to OpenClaw 2026.2.19-2. Health monitor cron scheduled every 6h (stops/restarts gateway if critical reconnect loop detected).\n- For Crypto mobile scope: WJP killed it. Not building.\n- For Crypto backup: 80 uncommitted files safely pushed to GitHub `backup/uncommitted-2026-02-20`. PR #7 (80 files, multiple features) open for WJP review.\n- KANSO Agency (Feb 20-21): Full 14-file launch package complete (proposal, GTM kit, day-1 script, 10 prospects, objection handler, discovery playbook, SOW, audit template, onboarding checklist, weekly report template). All in `ops/output/2026-02-20-agency-*`. DECISION: Kanso dropped by WJP (2026-02-21) - Claude can now audit smart contracts, making core offering worthless. Files archived for reference only.\n- forcrypto.market domain outage discovered Feb 21 (midnight): GoDaddy DNS misconfigured. A records missing. Users see parking page + ads instead of app. Fix: 2-min GoDaddy DNS update (A records 76.76.21.61 + 76.76.21.98, CNAME www \u2192 cname.vercel-dns.com). Brief: ops/output/2026-02-20-forcrypto-domain-outage.md. Escalated as \ud83d\udd34 BLOCKING ACTIVE WORK in NEEDS-WJP.md.\n\n## For Crypto Investment Plan (ref)\n- Convertible note: $250K, $10-12M cap, 15% discount, 8% interest, 3yr maturity.\n- NO AI/agent mentions in investor docs - say \"dev team.\"\n- File: for-crypto/investment-plan-250k.md\n\n## Key Learnings (Feb 23)\n- **Yama 1005 loop (ongoing):** Yama drops every ~30-40 min with Discord WS code 1005 (session invalidation). Pattern: 1006 \u2192 1005 \u00d7 2 \u2192 restart. Not a token issue. Health monitor cron increased 6h \u2192 1h for faster auto-recovery. Hypothesis: related to gateway update 2026.2.22-2. Monitor for improvement.\n- **SEO skill built:** /Users/kikai/clawd/skills/seo/ (technical-checklist.md, crypto-web3-seo.md, ai-readiness.md). SKILLS-INDEX.md now 29 skills total.\n- **SIWE required for /bots/new:** Email OTP session is dropped when SIWE wallet signature is needed. Don't assume email auth covers all protected routes.\n- **Always pull --rebase before push:** git push fails with \"fetch first\" if remote has diverged.\n\n## Key Learnings (Feb 20-22)\n- **Rate limit prevention:** Crons now plan-only. Main session = coordination. Sub-agents = execution. Tasks >5 tool calls \u2192 spawn sub-agent. Keeps main session under 60% context, avoiding API exhaustion.\n- **Continuous state writes:** All corrections/decisions/proper nouns \u2192 SESSION-STATE.md immediately, not end-of-session. Compaction happens at 70%+ context.\n- **Domain issues are critical:** forcrypto.market DNS misconfiguration broke API integrations. Always test deployed domains, not just localhost. Added to routine audits.\n- **Yama Discord stability:** OpenClaw outdated version (2026.2.15) caused token auth mismatch \u2192 26K reconnect failures. Now health-monitored. Update Yama every 4-6 weeks.\n- **Operational readiness:** Agency package proved that \"fully complete\" = zero build time from greenlight. All templated deliverables (SOW, proposal, discovery playbook, weekly report, objection handler, onboarding checklist) can be stamped and used immediately.\n- **Proactive research saves days:** Feb 20 non-crypto business research (proposal + GTM + templates) let WJP make one decision (Kanso) vs 5 smaller decisions. Upfront synthesis beats incremental asks.\n\n## Accounts\n- Email: kikaionchain@gmail.com | Handle: kikaionchain | Last name if needed: Onchain\n- Netlify: burned 300 build min/month via 12 auto-deploys/day (suspended Feb 20). Migrated to GitHub Pages (no build step).\n- Vercel: blocked (SMS). fal.ai: active (topped up Feb 20 for 67 posts).\n",
