Check this before morning brief.\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 Blocking Active Work\n\n### 🚨 CRITICAL: forcrypto.market is DOWN (GoDaddy parking page)\n**Ask:** Fix DNS in GoDaddy. 2-minute task.\n**What's happening:** All traffic to forcrypto.market hits a GoDaddy ad/parking page. The app works at for-crypto.vercel.app but not on the real domain.\n**Root cause:** Domain nameservers are GoDaddy (ns57/ns58.domaincontrol.com), DNS was never configured to point at Vercel.\n**Fix:** GoDaddy dashboard → forcrypto.market DNS → Add A record: `@` → `76.76.21.61` and `76.76.21.98`. Add CNAME: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`.\n**Full brief:** `ops/output/2026-02-20-forcrypto-domain-outage.md`\n**Impact:** Anyone clicking any link to forcrypto.market sees ads.

Market timing is ideal right now.\n**Brief:** `ops/output/2026-02-20-67-brand-direction.md` (strategic playbook, 11KB)\n**Context:** Posts disabled Feb 19 due to fal.ai balance ($0 → now fixed). Solana momentum is hot. Cultural narrative around \"ironic meme coins\" is trending.\n**What happens on GO:** I enable posts, implement Phase 1 (community rebuild), set up influencer partnerships\n**Opportunity window:** ~2-3 weeks before cycle cools.
